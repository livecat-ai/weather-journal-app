# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
The Weather-Journal App keeps a record of the weather at a location of your choice. 

## Installation
First we need to make sure all the software dependancies are in place.
To that, in the project root directory type:
npm init
npm install express --save-prod
npm install cors --save-prod
npm install body-parser --save-prod


## Instructions

To start the server runing on localhost:3000, navigate to the project root directory and type:
node server.js


Now in a web browser address bar type:
http://localhost:3000

You should now be able to type any valid zip code, any comments you may wish to make and then click the <Generate> button.

The contents of the most recent entry text box will now by update with the latest data.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
